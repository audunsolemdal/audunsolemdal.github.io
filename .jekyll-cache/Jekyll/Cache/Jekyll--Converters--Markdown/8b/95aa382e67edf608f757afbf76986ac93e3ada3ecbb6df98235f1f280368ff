I"%<p>I’ve decided to make a series on how to increase your productivity on Windows 10. The series will mainly be focused for people in the IT industry, but most of the articles in this series will have some carryover to all Windows users.</p>

<p>Some of the reasoning behind this is that after starting my latest job I’ve been surrounded with people having their highly customized personal setup on Linux or MacOS. And I’ll have to say that some of the things they showed me impressed me, and I wondered if I could do the same in Windows.</p>
