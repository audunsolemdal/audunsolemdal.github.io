Near lifelong experience with computers and Microsoft tech. After the boom in open source, cloud and containers, I now embrace the "best of both worlds" in terms of Microsoft vs Linux. I have a background in IT operations, but started my career around developers. Special interest for Azure. I consider myself a good all-rounder, both in terms of technical know-how and at the business level.

Currently (May 2022) self employed full time in my own company, Solom AS. I have a main project for Helsedirektoratet, and a side project for Elekt AS. I work broadly with .NET development, cloud consulting, automation etc.

I am also a registered Cloud solution provider through Arrow. Contact me if you are interested!
