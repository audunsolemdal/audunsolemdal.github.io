Near lifelong experience with computers and Microsoft tech. After the boom in open source, cloud and containers, I now embrace the "best of both worlds" in terms of Microsoft vs Linux. I have a background in IT operations, but started my career around developers. Special interest for Azure. I consider myself a good all-rounder, both in terms of technical know-how and at the business level.

Currently employed full time at Bouvet ASA with projects for Equinor. In my projects I work with Azure, Kubernetes and Cloud native apps, software development in .NET, and IT operations in both Linux and Windows.

I also work freelance projects in my spare time under my own company Solemdal Consulting.
