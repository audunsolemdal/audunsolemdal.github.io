## Our services

###  Platform

Need a cloud platform implemented, preferably last year? You are not alone.

We have experience in both setting up cloud environments from scratch, and can help you get started with your cloud journey. If you are an existing Azure client, we can help you optimize your existing cloud environment according to your business needs.
Our clients are all managed by standardized infrastructure as code. This means that we can quickly and efficiently set up new environments. The code will be your IP, and you will have full control over your platform's high-quality, secure and scalable IaC code.

Among the things we can provide for your platform are:
- High level design for your platform platform based on Microsoft's best practices (Cloud Adoption Framework)
